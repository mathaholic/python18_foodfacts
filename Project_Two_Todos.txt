Question one: Measure nutritionality of foods in the database against recommendations.

1. Find a way to compare the list of nutrients for which IOM makes recommendations and the list available in our dataset.

2. Create a dictionary that includes nutrients as keys and IOM RDAs as values, for our target individual.

2. a) Are we going to use an adult male as our target individual?  Recs are available for different genders & age brackets.

3. Create a function that totals the amount of nutrients from each item in our basket, then compares them to the RDA, returning whether nutritionally satisfactory or not.

Question Two: Search product for hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup.     

1. Create a function that reads in ingredients from the database.  

2. Check for integrity of the read-in data (alternate words for HFCS etc.)

3. Create a function that reads item data and flags for keywords.

4. Compute the frequency of keywords in the database.

Question Three: Determine the frequency of nutrient dense foods in the dataset.

1. We can use the UK's nutritionality rating here:

 a) Find the frequency of occurrence of this field, determine if sufficient

 b) If insufficient, find the metrics behind the number and supplement existing by constructing new field (similar to Energy approach)

2. We can find our own means of determining nutrient density: define, apply, summarise.
